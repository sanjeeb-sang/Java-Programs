; The Scheme program starts

; A method to display the weather condition of a place based on a list of temperatures
; Input - temps - a list containing the temperatures. 
; It, temps, contains five integers that represent the current temperature, the normal high 
; temperature the normal low temperature, the high temperature on that day the previous year, and the
; low temperature on that day the previous year.
(define (weather temps)
  (cond
    
    ; Check if the temperature is hot
    [(> (car temps) (car (cdr temps))) 
     
        ; Define the first part of the output as p to print later
        (define p "It is hot ") 
        
        ; Another cond to compare current temperature with last year's temperatures
        (cond 
          ((and (> (car temps) (car (cdr temps))) (< (car temps) (car (cdddr temps)))) 
            (print p "but not as hot as last year.")
          )
          (else (print p "just like last year."))
        )
    ]
      
    
    ; Check if the weather is cold
    [(< (car temps) (car (cddr temps)))
      
      ; Define the first part of the output as p to print later
      (define p "It is cold ")
      
      ; Another cond to compare current temperature with last year's temperatures
      (cond 
            
        ((and (< (car temps) (car (cddr temps))) (> (car temps) (car (cddddr temps))))
          (print p "but not as cold as last year.")
        )
        (else (print p "just like last year."))
      )
    ]
  
  
    ; if the weather isn't hot or cold, and is between the hot and cold weather
    [else 
      (print "It is nice just like last year.")
    ]

; The method Ends
